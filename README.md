## Currently
A Chalk demo is currently under development. I've teamed up with [QuantumFluctuator](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator) and we hope to end up with a demo that could expand into a full game. The demo version will contain at least 6 levels with several special block interactions. The game will also be taking a more puzzle-like approach.
