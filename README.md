## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub

I currently have 2 live websites.
1. My portfolio website -> [CLICK HHERE][https://soranaioanamarin.com/]
1. My projects website -> [CLICK HERE][https://simprojects.cf/]

## Some of my projects
1. Weekado - a php productivity app, based on the Indistractable model by Nir Eyal.
2. Portativ 2 - a music tracker created using javascript.
3. Chalk - a 2D platformer game with chalk-like mechanics.

## Currently
A Chalk demo is currently under development. I've teamed up with (QuantumFluctuator)[https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator] and we hope to end up with a demo that could expand into a full game. The demo version will contain at least 6 levels with several special block interactions. The game will also be taking a more puzzle-like approach. 

However these plans are halted right now due to university work, specifically my final year project, a mapping application that will crowdsource pedestrian interest points. (mapping blankspots)
